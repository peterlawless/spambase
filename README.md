# Spamtastic

## Synopsis

This repository is simply a machine learning experiment using scikit-learn
to create a classification model that will determine whether or not emails are
spam.

The data used in this experiment was taken from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository and can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase.

Open the spambase.ipynb file to see how I created the model, and how effective
(or ineffective) the model is.
